title: "🔁 v1.1.0 - Implement Retry Mechanism for Flaky Tests"
milestone: v1.1.0
labels: retry, framework, reliability, flaky-tests

## 📌 Objective
Implement a retry mechanism using TestNG's `IRetryAnalyzer` to automatically re-run failed tests a configurable number of times. This improves build stability by mitigating the impact of flaky tests caused by transient issues (e.g., network latency, slow rendering).

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A `RetryAnalyzer` class is created that implements `IRetryAnalyzer`.
- [ ] The retry logic includes a configurable maximum retry count (e.g., 2 retries).
- [ ] The analyzer is attached to test methods via the `@Test(retryAnalyzer = RetryAnalyzer.class)` annotation.
- [ ] The test execution clearly logs each retry attempt.
- [ ] The final Allure report accurately reflects the total number of attempts and the final status (pass after retry, or fail after all retries).
- [ ] A test that fails intermittently is successfully retried and can pass on a subsequent attempt.
