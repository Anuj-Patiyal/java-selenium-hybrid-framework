## üìå Objective
Design and implement a standardized exception handling strategy across the framework to gracefully manage errors, improve robustness, and provide clear, actionable feedback in logs and reports.

---

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A custom exception class (e.g., `FrameworkException`) is created for framework-specific errors.
- [ ] Key utility methods and operations (e.g., driver initialization, element finding) include try-catch blocks.
- [ ] All caught exceptions are logged using the integrated Log4j2 logger with clear messages and severity levels (ERROR).
- [ ] Exceptions are re-thrown or handled in a way that fails the test gracefully with a meaningful message.
- [ ] The existing `TextBoxTest` remains stable and logs errors appropriately if forced to fail.
