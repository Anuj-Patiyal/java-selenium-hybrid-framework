## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Develop a utility to capture and save screenshots automatically on test failure. This is critical for visual debugging and providing evidence of the application state at the point of failure.

---

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A `ScreenshotUtils` class is created with a static method `captureScreenshot(WebDriver driver, String testName)`.
- [ ] The utility saves screenshots in the PNG format.
- [ ] Screenshots are saved to a dedicated directory (e.g., `test-output/screenshots/`), creating it if it doesn't exist.
- [ ] Each screenshot file is uniquely named (e.g., `TestName_TIMESTAMP.png`).
- [ ] The screenshot functionality is integrated to trigger automatically on test failure via a TestNG listener.
- [ ] A screenshot is successfully captured and saved for a intentionally failed test.

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Notes
- The `TakesScreenshot` interface from Selenium should be used.
- Consider using Java's `LocalDateTime` to generate a unique timestamp for the filename.
