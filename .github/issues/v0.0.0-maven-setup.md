## 📌 Description
Initialize the foundational Maven project structure for the hybrid test automation framework. This establishes the build management, core dependencies, basic directory layout, and project documentation, serving as the cornerstone for all subsequent development.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A new Maven project is initialized with a correctly structured and validated `pom.xml`.
- [ ] All specified dependencies are included with their correct versions.
- [ ] All specified plugins are configured with their correct versions and settings.
- [ ] A standard `.gitignore` file for Java/Maven/IDE is present and functional.
- [ ] A comprehensive `README.md` is added, containing all outlined sections.
- [ ] The basic source directory structure is created and follows standard Maven conventions.
- [ ] The project can be successfully compiled using `mvn clean compile`.

## 🛠 Required Dependencies & Plugins
**Core Dependencies:**
- [ ] `org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-java` (v4.34.0)
- [ ] `org.testng:testng` (v7.11.0)

**Maven Plugins:**
- [ ] `org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin` (v3.14.0)
  - Configured to use Java **21** as both source and target version.
- [ ] `org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-clean-plugin` (v3.5.0)
- [ ] `org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin` (v3.2.5) - For future TestNG execution.

## 📁 Expected Project Structure
```plaintext
project-root/
├── src/
│   ├── main/java/          # For future framework core classes and utilities
│   └── test/java/          # For test classes, runners, and suites
├── resources/              # For configuration files (e.g., log4j2.xml)
├── .gitignore             # Excludes target/, .idea/, *.iml, etc.
├── pom.xml                # Project Object Model - Core configuration
└── README.md              # Project documentation
``` 

## 📋 Implementation Notes
- The `README.md` should include:
  - Framework Overview & Goals
  - Feature Table
  - Technology Stack (Java, Selenium, TestNG, Maven)
  - Setup Instructions
  - Roadmap (link to Milestones)
  - Author & License Information
