title: "ðŸš€ v0.2.0 - Continuous Integration (CI) Setup with GitHub Actions"
milestone: v0.2.0
labels: ci, github-actions, infrastructure
assignees: 
---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Implement a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions to automatically build the project and execute tests on every push and pull request to the main branch, ensuring early detection of integration issues.

---

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A GitHub Actions workflow (`.yml` file) is created in the `.github/workflows/` directory.
- [ ] The workflow is triggered on `push` to and `pull_request` against the main branch.
- [ ] The workflow checks out the code, sets up Java 21, and configures the Maven cache.
- [ ] The workflow runs the command `mvn clean test` successfully.
- [ ] The workflow execution pass/fail status is clearly visible on GitHub.

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Notes
- The workflow should use a standard setup with `actions/checkout@v4` and `actions/setup-java@v3`.
- Consider caching Maven dependencies to speed up subsequent workflow runs.
- Name the workflow file appropriately (e.g., `maven-ci.yml`).
