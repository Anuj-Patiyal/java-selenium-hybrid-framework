title: "🌐 v0.5.0 - Implement Robust WebDriver Management System"
milestone: v0.5.0
labels: driver, framework, infrastructure, browser
assignees:
---

## 📌 Objective
Design and implement a centralized, thread-safe WebDriver management system (`DriverManager` or `DriverFactory`) to handle the complete lifecycle of browser instances, enabling support for multiple browsers and ensuring stable test execution.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A `DriverManager` class is created to encapsulate all driver-related operations.
- [ ] The system supports initialization of at least Chrome and Firefox drivers based on a configuration parameter.
- [ ] Driver initialization is robust and handles common exceptions (e.g., `WebDriverException`, invalid browser names).
- [ ] A `getDriver()` method provides access to the thread-safe driver instance.
- [ ] A `quitDriver()` method properly closes the browser and nullifies the driver instance.
- [ ] The existing `TextBoxTest` is refactored to use the new `DriverManager` instead of instantiating drivers directly.
- [ ] The test execution remains stable and successful after the refactor.

## 📋 Implementation Notes
- Consider using the `java.lang.System.getProperty()` for reading browser type from the command line or a configuration file in the future.
- The design should be scalable to easily add support for new browsers (Edge, Safari) and modes (headless, remote).
