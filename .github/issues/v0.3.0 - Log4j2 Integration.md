title: "📝 v0.3.0 - Integrate Log4j2 for Structured Logging"
milestone: v0.3.0
labels: logging, enhancement, monitoring
assignees: 
---

## 📌 Objective
Integrate Log4j2 as the centralized logging framework to provide structured, configurable logging for better traceability, debugging, and monitoring of test execution.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The correct Log4j2 dependencies are added to `pom.xml`.
- [ ] A `log4j2.xml` configuration file is created in `/src/main/resources/`.
- [ ] The configuration defines console and file appenders with appropriate log levels (e.g., INFO, DEBUG, ERROR).
- [ ] Logger instances are implemented in key classes (e.g., test base class, future utilities).
- [ ] Informational log statements are added for test start/end and key actions.
- [ ] Error logging is implemented in catch blocks.
- [ ] Log files are generated in a specified directory (e.g., `logs/`) upon test execution, and console output is enhanced.

## 🛠 Dependencies to Add
- [ ] `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` 
- [ ] `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api`
- [ ] `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-slf4j2-impl`
