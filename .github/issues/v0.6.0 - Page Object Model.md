## 📌 Objective
Refactor the framework to adopt the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. This will encapsulate page-specific locators and actions into dedicated classes, significantly enhancing test maintainability, readability, and reducing code duplication.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A base `Page.java` class is created with common methods (e.g., click, sendKeys, getTitle) accessible to all page classes.
- [ ] A `TextBoxPage.java` class is created, encapsulating all locators and actions for the DemoQA Text Box page.
- [ ] Locators are defined using `By` and are `private`.
- [ ] Public methods are created to represent user actions (e.g., `enterFullName(String name)`, `clickSubmit()`).
- [ ] The `TextBoxTest` is refactored to use the new `TextBoxPage` object for all interactions.
- [ ] Test logic is separated from page interaction logic, making the test class cleaner and more focused on assertions.

## 📋 Implementation Notes
- The base `Page` class should ideally receive a `WebDriver` instance in its constructor.
- Page class methods should return other page objects or themselves where appropriate to enable fluent-style calling (e.g., `return this;`).
