## üìå Objective
Create a centralized utility class for handling dynamic element synchronization using Selenium's explicit waits (`WebDriverWait`). This will replace the use of static `Thread.sleep()` calls, making tests more reliable and efficient.

---

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A `WaitUtils` class is created with static methods for common wait conditions.
- [ ] Methods are implemented for:
  - [ ] `waitForElementToBeVisible(By locator)`
  - [ ] `waitForElementToBeClickable(By locator)`
  - [ ] `waitForElementToBePresent(By locator)`
- [ ] A configurable default timeout is used across all wait methods.
- [ ] The `TextBoxPage` class is refactored to use `WaitUtils` before interacting with elements (e.g., before clicking Submit).
- [ ] All `Thread.sleep()` statements are removed from the codebase.
- [ ] Tests execute faster and more reliably against the dynamic web page.
