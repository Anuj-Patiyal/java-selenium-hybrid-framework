## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Create a custom TestNG listener to hook into test execution lifecycle events (start, success, failure, skip). This will be used to enhance logging, attach screenshots on failure, and set up preconditions for advanced reporting.

---

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A `TestListener` class is created that implements `ITestListener`.
- [ ] The `onTestFailure` method calls the `ScreenshotUtils.captureScreenshot` method.
- [ ] All listener methods (`onTestStart`, `onTestSuccess`, `onTestSkipped`, `onTestFailure`) log informative messages using Log4j2.
- [ ] The listener is successfully attached to the test execution via the `testng.xml` file.
- [ ] Test execution produces enhanced logs and automatically captures screenshots only on failure.
