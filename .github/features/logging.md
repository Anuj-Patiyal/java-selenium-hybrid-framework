# 📝 Centralized Logging Integration (`v0.3.0`)

This PR introduces a robust **centralized logging system** into the Java Selenium Hybrid Automation Framework, enabling enhanced debugging, traceability, and reporting.

## 📁 Project Highlights

- **Logger Setup**: Centralized utility using SLF4J + Logback
- **Log Structure**: Unified format across all test layers
- **Integration**: Page Object, TestNG hooks, Utils, and error handling
- **Configuration**: Externalized log config (logback.xml) with appenders

## 🧩 Key Features

### Logging System
- ✅ SLF4J facade with Logback backend
- ✅ Configurable log levels: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
- ✅ Pattern-based layout with timestamps, thread, and class context
- ✅ Console + File appenders (rolling + date-based)

### Code Enhancements
- Logging added to:
  - Driver manager lifecycle
  - Page actions & verifications
  - Test setup/teardown (TestNG)
  - Exception handlers and retry analyzers

### Configuration
- `/resources/logback.xml` for all logging controls
- Logs stored under `/logs` with per-run segregation
- Easy switch to cloud logging (e.g., ELK) in future

## 🧪 Validation Results

| Scenario| Status |
|------------------------------|--------|
| Logging during tests| ✅ |
| Multi-thread log handling| ✅ |
| File rotation and size limits | ✅ |
| Log presence in CI runs| ✅ |
| Exception trace logging| ✅ |

## 🔗 Milestone
- **Version:** `v0.3.0 – Logging`
- **Target Date:** 2025-09-02
- **Progress:** 100%
- **Branch:** `feature/logging` → `dev`

## 👥 Review Checklist
- [x] Logs are consistent and contextual
- [x] Logging does not affect test performance
- [x] Sensitive data is masked or excluded
- [x] External configuration is used
- [x] Documentation updated (log usage + config)

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Merge into `dev`
- Add log upload as CI artifact
- Enable log-based debugging on CI failures
- Evaluate integration with cloud logging platforms

## 📊 Metrics
| Metric| Before Logging| After Logging |
|----------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Debug Time| High | Reduced |
| Test Traceability| Low | High |
| Error Analysis| Manual | Log-driven |
| CI Observability | Basic | Enhanced |
| Runtime Impact | — | Negligible |
