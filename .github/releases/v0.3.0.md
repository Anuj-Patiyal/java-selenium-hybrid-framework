# 🚀 Release `v0.3.0` – Centralized Logging

This release delivers the finalized **centralized logging system** for the Java Selenium Hybrid Automation Framework. The logging integration improves observability, speeds up debugging, and ensures consistent traceability across test runs.

- Page-level interactions (clicks, inputs, waits)
- Test setup/teardown via TestNG
- Retry analyzer and exception stack traces

### ✅ Logging Features
- Unified log format with timestamps, thread ID, and context
- Log level control: `TRACE` to `ERROR`
- Per-run log files under `/logs` with rotation

### ✅ CI/CD Integration
